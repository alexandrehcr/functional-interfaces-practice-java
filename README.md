# Practice with Java's Comparable and Comparator Interfaces

This repository contains the code used to practice the use of the functional interfaces _Comparable_ and _Comparator_, and their implementation using anonymous classes and lambda expressions. The code sorts a list of products by name and price using different techniques. Each commit demonstrates a different approach for sorting, providing a clear comparison of the techniques used.
